# PF2e Expansion Pack

The PF2e Expansion Pack module is back and remade for the latest version of Foundry! Featuring the Pnoll ancestry by Logan Bonner and the Rabbitfolk ancestry by Luis Loza, with more content to come!

## Pnoll Ancestry by Logan Bonner

The Pnoll is a new ancestry designed by Pathfinder Lead Designer and published at Drive Through RPG by Logan Bonner Games. Logan was kind enough to give permission for his work to be distributed in this module. If you like this please go visit [DTRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/324196/The-Pnoll-An-Ancestry) and purchase the PDF to get all the excellent art and support charity.

## Rabbitfolk Ancestry by Luis Loza
The Rabbitfolk is a new ancestry designed by Paizo developer Luis Loza and published by Novacat Games. Luis generously allowed me to add his work to the module. Be sure to visit [Luis' blog](https://www.luisloza.com/blog/) to see all the other content, and visit [DTRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/347915/Ancestries-Unleashed-Rabbitfolk) to get a copy of the Rabbitfolk PDF for yourself. Also consider supporting [Luis on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/luisloza).

### Older Content

Unfortunately, not all of the previous content that was in this module made the jump to this new version. To keep the size of this module maintainable I have decided to limit this version of the module to purely 2nd party material. I have also set the module up with a proper release script, which will allow others to more easily contribute to the module if mistakes are made or new automation becomes possible. To the authors whose content got left out of this update, I apologize, but it was either cut back the content or continue leaving the module archived entirely.
