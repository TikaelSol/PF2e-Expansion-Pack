In actuality, you fall @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone} and only appear to be dead, a ruse enhanced by a unique odor you emit, similar to the smell of decay. The next time you act, you cease playing dead. Any creature that believed you were dead is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg] against the first hostile action you take on the turn you stop appearing dead. Any creature that realizes you played dead is temporarily immune to Play Dead for 24 hours.</p><p>A creature attempting to determine whether you're alive must attempt a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1xRFPTFtWtGJ9ELw]{Sense Motive} check against your Deception DC or Performance DC, and you get a +2 circumstance bonus to the DC in question against such a check. If your fake death seems absurd—for instance, if you're a barbarian at full health and appear to be slain by 2 damage—the GM might grant the attacker this check immediately.</p>",
